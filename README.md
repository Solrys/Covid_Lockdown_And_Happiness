# Covid_Lockdown_And_Happiness
Finding a corelation and prediction for world happiness and lockdown dates.

Lockdown data from all of the world was collected. 
* When Did Lockdown Start
* What Type of lockdown was enforced, Full, Partial, No Lockdown. 

I have merged that dataset with the world happiness report to explore correlating patterns while comparing "happiness" to the previous years.
